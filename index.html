      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <section align="justify" id="tribute-info">
        Turing was born in Maida Vale, London, while his father, Julius Mathison
        Turing (1873–1947), was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil
        Service (ICS) at Chatrapur, then in the Madras Presidency and presently
        in Odisha state, in India. Turing's father was the son of a clergyman,
        the Rev. John Robert Turing, from a Scottish family of merchants that
        had been based in the Netherlands and included a baronet. Turing's
        mother, Julius's wife, was Ethel Sara Turing (née Stoney 1881–1976),
        daughter of Edward Waller Stoney, chief engineer of the Madras Railways.
        The Stoneys were a Protestant Anglo-Irish gentry family from both County
        Tipperary and County Longford, while Ethel herself had spent much of her
        childhood in County Clare. Julius's work with the ICS brought the family
        to British India, where his grandfather had been a general in the Bengal
        Army. However, both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought
        up in Britain, so they moved to Maida Vale, London, where Alan Turing
        was born on 23 June 1912, as recorded by a blue plaque on the outside of
        the house of his birth, later the Colonnade Hotel. Turing had an elder
        brother, John (the father of Sir John Dermot Turing, 12th Baronet of the
        Turing baronets). Turing's father's civil service commission was still
        active and during Turing's childhood years, his parents travelled
        between Hastings in the United Kingdom and India, leaving their two sons
        to stay with a retired Army couple. At Hastings, Turing stayed at Baston
        Lodge, Upper Maze Hill, St Leonards-on-Sea, now marked with a blue
        plaque. The plaque was unveiled on 23 June 2012, the centenary of
        Turing's birth. Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius
        that he was later to display prominently. His parents purchased a house
        in Guildford in 1927, and Turing lived there during school holidays. The
        location is also marked with a blue plaque.

    <h2>Carrer and Research</h2>
    <section align="justify">
      When Turing returned to Cambridge, he attended lectures given in 1939 by
      Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics. The lectures
      have been reconstructed verbatim, including interjections from Turing and
      other students, from students' notes. Turing and Wittgenstein argued and
      disagreed, with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein propounding
      his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths, but
      rather invents them. <br />
